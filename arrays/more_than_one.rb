=begin
 Write some code that selects 'fish' and 'lizard' from the pets array - 
 select the two items at the same time. Assign the return value to a 
 variable named my_pets, then print the contents of my_pets as a single 
 string, e.g.:   
=end

pets = ['cat', 'dog', 'fish', 'lizard']

my_pets = pets[2..3]
puts "I have a pet #{my_pets[0]} and a pet #{my_pets[1]}!"
